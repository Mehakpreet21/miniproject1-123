# Step by Step Tutorial

### Forking
Forking allows the user to create a "forked" version of the orginal project. This forked repository makes sure the user can experiment without the risk of ruining the original project. The main difference with a fork is that there still remains a connection between the original repository and the forked copy. Therefore, it will always be monitored and compared with the original repository. Changes can be  made to the original repository using pull requests. Any collaborator can edit the code and send a pull request to the owner. If the owner approves, they can merge the changes to the original version.

**Steps to Fork:**
* In GitHub, navigate to repository that you want to fork
* click the green Fork button on the upper right corner
* GitHub will send you the newly forked repository
* you can now make changes and send pull requests to the owner
