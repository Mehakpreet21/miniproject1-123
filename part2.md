## What is GitFlow?
It's a branching model for Git. It acts as a wrapper around Git. It's an extension of the default git init cmman and doesnt change anyhting in your repository other than creating branches for you.
### **GitFlow Workflow**
GitFlow is an abstract idea of Git workflow. It uses two branches to record the history of the project
instead of just one. The master and Develop branch.
1. Master Branch:
Stores the official release history of the project
2. Develop Branch:
Serves as an integration branch for features.
	* The “release branch” is made off of develop.
